        <p>As we've seen PHPSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development framework
    which allows you to write code examples which can be executed time and
    time again. It also supports the practice of BDD by focusing its API on a
    readable Domain Specific Language modelled after Plain English.</p>
        <p>What goals does PHPSpec seek to fulfill?</p>

              <span class="term">focus attention on specifying behaviour instead of
        testing</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Behaviour-Driven Development is all about behaviour. How any
          class behaves can only be described accurately and efficiently by
          referring to its public interface and properties, its goals and
          specifications, its purpose in existing. In designing better code,
          writing examples of behaviour before implementing the code has
          proven a successful methodology.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">offer a readable intuitive language for writing
        specifications</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>An example is worth a thousand words, especially if the code
          it's written in is readable by a non-programmer. By offering a
          fluent interface API closely approximating grammatically correct
          English we make examples even more valuable. This "domain specific
          language" reduces the cost of translating between the natural
          language with which we think, and the syntax of PHP.</p>

              <span class="term">support the goals of Behaviour-Driven Development</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Behaviour-Driven Development is a progressive method of
          practising the true requirements of Test-Driven Development and
          avoids the common pitfalls that has made TDD difficult to adopt by
          many programmers. It shifts the focus from a viewpoint of Testing to
          the more valuable viewpoint of Specifying Behaviour. The change in
          language is accompanied by a shift in how we combine elements of TDD
          with Domain-Driven Design, Acceptance-Testing Driven Design and the
          concepts of User Stories and Scenarios.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Although PHPSpec is formulated as a framework to support
          Behaviour-Driven Development it is not monumentally difference from
          existing Unit Testing frameworks. It's execution and reporting is
          similar to most xUnit style frameworks in any language. Its API is
          deliberately modelled on plain English and easy to
          comprehend.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>PHPSpec is derived from existing BDD frameworks for Java,
          Smalltalk, .NET and Ruby. It's syntax borrows from these sources
          with a dash of PHP uniqueness. We endeavor to keep the framework as
          simple and flexible as possible. If it's not we encourage you to
          complain long and hard!</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>BDD is derived from several Agile and Extreme Programming
          practices. PHPSpec is more limited given it's relative youth but
          supporting features from Mock Objects (via PHPMock) to a full
          featured User Story and Scenario Runner are intended in subsequent
          versions.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>PHPSpec operates from the command line using the phpspec
          command. It's operation is inspired by the simplicity of PEAR QA's
          phpt execution. We'll expand the command line features over time as
          required by the user base.</p>

              <p>A near essential tool for any Ruby developer is the fabulous
          Autotest. Expect a PHP clone to emerge in the near future. For the
          moment you can continually run your specs in the background using
          the command line -a flag.</p>
